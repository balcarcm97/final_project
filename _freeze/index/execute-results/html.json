There are many factors that go into the quality of air but some stick out more than others. PM2.5 refers to fine particles of pollution and they have been confirmed to lead to heart disease, asthma, and other pulmonary issues [@DepartmentofHealth_2024]. Air pollution is an especially concerning form of pollution because it’s one that people may not be fully aware that they’re exposed to. However, its consequences can be very severe, and in the long run could be considered a silent killer. Over multiple studies, information has been discovered of its effects on human health ranging from multiple conditions [@malik2024]. PM2.5 isn’t the only thing to be concerned about though, there are many other particulates that are of concern and should be on everyone's radar. From ozone to nitrogen dioxide, the presence of these pollutants can greatly impact vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Continued monitoring and stricter regulations may be essential to reducing long-term exposure and protecting public health [@monoson2023air].\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 2em;\">\nIn addition, the world saw another detrimental contributor to reduced pulmonary health: COVID-19. Some studies suggested worsening asthma and worse covid symptoms when exposed to both [@agondi2022worsening]. This indicates that people in areas of high pollution and asthma likely had a very difficult time during the initial outbreak of covid and the years that came after it. While a pandemic will be impossible to predict in the future, reduction in air pollution is a lot more feasible. By examining the severity of asthma, we can hopefully have more preventative measures in case other extreme instances of diseases that affect pulmonary health spring up. This way, if another event like covid happens, more extensive measures could be taken to help out its more vulnerable residents. It also highlights the importance of creating healthier urban environments that reduce exposure risks in the first place. Investing in cleaner technologies and infrastructure now could make a significant difference in how societies handle future health crises.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 2em;\">\nWe were able to pull 4 sets of data. The first that we found was the most recent data of asthma prevalence and mortality. Unfortunately these data sets only went up to 2021 which limits the scope of this project. However, the CDC provides some great information. It not only provides the total number of people with asthma but it also gives us a percentage by state which is very useful for nationwide analysis. In addition they also provide mortality rates, and looking at the data, while the numbers are (thankfully) not very large, it could still provide valuable insights. Since this data only goes up to 2021, air quality data from the EPA was pulled to match this window of time. The EPA keeps records of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, PM2.5, PM10 and lead as measures of air quality. They also include a key to show when levels are above the standard. There appear to be a good amount of missing data points but thankfully the data seems robust enough to use. Finally, we included a dataset of total covid cases by county, but state data would likely be more useful and manageable. By having this information, we can see what states were hit the hardest and had the most cases.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 2em;\">\nThere are multiple avenues for methodology with the data that we have. First and foremost, we could consolidate our air quality data to examine each pollutant and get a total count of how many counties exceed the acceptable level. Once we have these amounts we can rank states by how many counties they have that exceed certain pollutants. After this we can rank them and see which are the worst. In addition, for our covid data, we can consolidate our data into state counts to see which states were hit the hardest with cases. While our worst polluted states and states with most covid cases may not line up, it will be interesting to see if there are states where both are prevalent. Once we have states with the most extreme parameters, we could cross-reference it with the number of asthma cases and mortality rates. While the work may have to be extensive, we could also go deeper and look at each pollutant in the air quality data and reference it with the rest of our data. If we are able to find a correlation between these environmental factors and asthma, we could also implement some machine learning for further analysis. We can look at how pollutants and their levels could predict asthma and possibly other pulmonary issues. Predicting data like this could be very useful when it comes to providing motivation to keep pollution levels low. When the human impact could be easily quantifiable, it could become easier to convince stakeholders.\n</p>\n\n# Data Exploration\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nEPA_air_quality <- read.csv(\"conreport2021.csv\")\nasthma_prevalence <- read.csv(\"CDC_asthma_2021.csv\")\nasthma_mort <- read.csv(\"CDC_asthma_mort2021.csv\")\ncovid_data3 <- read.csv(\"covid_confirmed_usafacts.csv\")\ncovid_county <- read.csv(\"us-counties-2021.csv\")\ncombined_data <- read.csv(\"combined_data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## EPA Air Quality Data 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nvisdat::vis_dat(EPA_air_quality)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n-   This dataset comes from the EPA and it shows air quality in 2021.

Since the data set is large we will condense it down into state totals.\n\n# Methods Identification\n\n-   From our data, we feel like we have a lot of air quality parameters to work with which can be very useful as we can explore multiple factors at once. We may already have all the data that we need, but there's a chance that could look at other respiratory illnesses in addition to asthma.\n\n-   A big challenge is the covid data because it's just so robust. However, with a lot of cleaning, it could work out. In addition, understanding some of the air quality indices may be challenging but if we focus on 1 or 2, it should be no big issue.\n\n-   Another challenge could just be that the data doesn't go our way when we apply our methods. In that case, we could bring in separate previously mentioned respiratory illness data that could be used.\n\n-   Our methods could lead us to find a correlation between environmental factors like air quality and covid to see its effect on asthma (and possible other respiratory illnesses) because we will be directly comparing them.\n\n# Methods\n\n# Correlation Matrix \nAfter the combination of data with State as our common parameters across all of them, we were able to get a dataset that included total PM2.5 means in states, total asthma cases in states, and total covid cases in states for 2021. This combination of the data allows us to run a correlation matrix in order to assess possible correlation.\n## Fig 1\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(corrplot)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\ncorrplot 0.95 loaded\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\ncor_matrix <- combined_data %>%\n  select(pm25, asthma, covid) %>%\n  cor(use = \"complete.obs\")\n\ncorrplot(cor_matrix, method = \"color\", type = \"upper\", \n         tl.col = \"black\", tl.srt = 45, addCoef.col = \"white\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis correlation matrix tells us a lot. There is a high positive correlation between PM2.5 asthma and Covid which makes sense because it's well known that PM2.5 is particularly harmful to the lungs. However, asthma and covid rates have the absolute highest correlation rates with a score really close 1.0. Given that Covid was a very severe respiratory illness, it's no surprise that people with asthma were in higher danger. However with that added danger of pollution, these cases could have been made worse. This high correlation will allow us to easily visualize our data as well as use predictive models to see how surges in covid cases or spikes in pollution can affect the rest. \n\n# Graphing and Visualization\nBesides the correlation matrix, we also decided to create two bar graphs. The first bar graph looks at the top 5 states in the United States with the worst air quality levels(PM2.5) and their asthma rates. The next graph looks at the top 5 states with the most amount of Covid-19 cases and their asthma cases. In these two graphs we hope to find some sort of visual correlation between air quality and asthma rates, as well as Covid-19 cases and asthma rates.\n\n## Fig 2. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ntop5_polluted <- combined_data %>%\n  arrange(desc(pm25)) %>%\n  slice(1:5)\n\nggplot(top5_polluted, aes(x = reorder(State, -pm25), y = Number.With.Current.Asthma., fill = State)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(\"PM2.5: \", round(pm25, 1))),\n            vjust = -0.5, size = 4.2, fontface = \"italic\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Top 5 Most Polluted States: Asthma Rates & PM2.5 Levels\",\n    x = \"State\",\n    y = \"Number with Current Asthma\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\", guide = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Fig 3 \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\ntop5_covid <- combined_data %>%\n  filter(State != \"Florida\") %>%\n  arrange(desc(total_cases)) %>%\n  slice(1:5)\n\nggplot(top5_covid, aes(x = reorder(State, -total_cases), y = Number.With.Current.Asthma., fill = State)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::comma(total_cases)),\n            vjust = -0.5, size = 4.2, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Top 5 States by COVID-19 Cases and Their Asthma Rates\",\n    x = \"State and Their COVID-19 Cases\",\n    y = \"Number with Current Asthma\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\", guide = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Modeling \nAs a predictive model, we are using a GLM (Generalized Linear Model).

The randomness in a GLM indicates that the model has the information that it needs and it's not missing anything to make the predictions.\n\n\n\n# Results \n<p style=\"text-indent: 2em;\">\nThe correlation matrix (Fig 1) gave us an early indicator that there was a strong correlation between 3 of our variables: PM2.5, COVID, and Asthma. A simple way to visualize this was through some graphing comparing the individual parameters on state levels.  Because we are going on a state-by-state basis, a time-series analysis would be ideal but that amount of data would be too much to work with, so the modeling was done to see how spikes in COVID cases or spikes in pollution could predict asthma cases. We have data that can show us some of the most impacted states and this was used to predict asthma rates using our GLM. For the model results, the increments by which asthma increased were not massive but they were very statistically significant. Higher COVID cases across states did mean that there would be more asthma cases but this wasn’t a big number because COVID cases are on a person by person basis, however for the PM2.5, this was an air measurement and every increase in this particulate in micro grams per meter cubed meant a 0.006336 increase in asthma rates which is not negligible. In the end though, better modeling can be done because while ours was simple, more data and predictive capabilities could likely be gleaned. However, based of our model and the residuals (Fig 4), it could be said that our model performed well.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 2em;\">\nFurthermore, two bar graphs were provided from the data. The first bar graph (Fig 2) looks at the top five states with the worst air quality and their asthma cases. For the most part, states with the worst air quality have the most asthma cases. However, Texas has more asthma cases with better air quality compared to the state of Pennsylvania. This may be due to the fact that Texas almost has double the population of Pennsylvania.Let it be noted that the elevated PM2.5 levels for each state reflect the combined air quality measurements from all its counties. On the other hand, the second bar graph (Fig 3) looks at the top 5 states with the most COVID cases and their asthma rates. Once again it seems like there is a correlation between a high amount of COVID cases and asthma cases. However, the state of Illinois, which has the fourth most COVID cases has the least amount of cases.\n</p>\n\n# Discussion \n<p style=\"text-indent: 2em;\">\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 2em;\">\nOur data was very correlative but the numbers weren’t big. However, with the data it’s clear that there is a link between air pollution (particularly PM2.5) and asthma so with something like COVID (or another respiratory illness pandemic) extra concern has to be taken to address areas with high pollution rates because they can be particularly hit hard. A better application of a study like this would be having it applied over a longer period of time in a time-series fashion, but that requires a lot more effort, time, and analysis. In addition, PM2.5 isn’t the only detrimental particulate that can be in our air. The EPA provides extensive research on harmful air pollution so more extensive analysis with that could be useful as well, however, here we are dealing with time and capability constraints. If more research is done like this with certain particulates being magnified though, perhaps more policy can be sought after to reduce their prevalence. \n</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 2em;\">\nAs it's been mentioned, our study primarily looked at PM2.5 because it is widely recognized as a very detrimental particulate. However, it is clear that this short study has merely scratched the surface. Other studies have been carried out in England to highlight the effects of pollution on COVID where they look at more in depth data with other harmful airborne pollutants [@travaglio2021links]. Another avenue that our study could have taken would be looking into socioeconomic status and how it can be a predictor for our asthma rates. This was something else that would have stretched us out to thin giving our limitations but disparities in socioeconomic status and pollution is widely documented here in the United States and heavily polluted countries like China [@wang2022ambient].\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 2em;\">\nThe biggest limitation was our time constraint for the work and also our very limited window of data that we had access to. Our data was focused on 2021 because that was the most recent set of data on asthma at the time and because our study incorporated COVID, we were unable to look at data before the pandemic. This could be a detrimental limitation because asthma proliferation could be a slow moving actor with its effects not being seen for a longer amount of time [@zhou2024effect]. In addition, studies looking at the intersection of pollution and COVID with respect to asthma is very novel. In fact, COVID's effect on asthma is still being looked into. A complete understanding of how all of these interact together has yet to be seen and that makes sense given that we are not too far removed from the pandemic. This research is still being carried out though because given that asthma and COVID are detrimental to respiratory systems, their relationship is being studied [@mendes2021asthma].\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 2em;\">\nA big reason we went down this path for our study was because the COVID pandemic left the sentiment that a worldwide pandemic was not something that was out of the realm of possibilities in our lifetime. At the time of the pandemic it felt like we were scrambling for solutions, but we have to make sure to keep our most susceptible out of harms way. We already know that pollution is a big factor when it comes to asthma hospitalizations in places with high concentrations of pollution, this was made clear by studies like Hayes study in Mexico City [@hayes2024relationship]. In addition here in the United States, clear evidence has suggested that reduction in pollution directly has led to reduction in asthma cases [@garcia2019association]. Given what we already know about pollution, we also have to look at how other respiratory illnesses come in to the equation. While COVID might feel like a concentrated event that was detrimental at the time, we cannot afford to be ill prepared moving on and more consideration has to be taken for the more susceptible residents. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
